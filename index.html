        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Arni Tiwari</strong>. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at Cal Poly SLO</p>
        <p>My hobbies include: reading and playing sports like basketball, badminton, tennis and table tennis. I have also recently decided to try crocheting.</p>
        <p>I have volunteered at <strong>Mitra Jyothi</strong>, an organization dedicated to helping the visually impaired in India. I edited textbooks, printed the textbooks in Braille and helped make crafts which would be sold later to make for the expenses of the visually impaired. I also worked for a blood donation campaign called <strong>Sankalp Foundation</strong> in my apartment in India. I helped design their posters to help advertise and spread awareness. I also went door to door campaigning to encourage and sign people up to donate blood. At the event, I made sure to explain the whole process of blood donation and health criteria with both advantages and side effects to make sure everyone felt safe and comfortable. During blood donation, I assisted the people to fill some forms and made sure they were in the right state of mind and health to donate blood. I have also completed <em>16 hours</em> of volunteering at <strong>Second Harvest</strong>, an organization that transports food to the underprivileged in the Bay Area. I helped maily with packing the food and making boxes to store the food.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to being a part of Hack4Impact to help develop technology to help more volunteer organizations.</p>
